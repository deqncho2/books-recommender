Synopsis: 
In 'The Gospel of Wealth', Andrew Carnegie presents a thought-provoking exploration of the responsibilities and moral obligations that come with immense wealth. Drawing from his own experiences as a self-made millionaire, Carnegie delves into the complexities of wealth accumulation and its impact on society. Through a series of insightful essays, he challenges conventional notions of philanthropy and advocates for a more strategic and systematic approach to giving back. With a blend of personal anecdotes, historical examples, and philosophical reflections, Carnegie offers a compelling argument for the redistribution of wealth and the pursuit of a more equitable society.
