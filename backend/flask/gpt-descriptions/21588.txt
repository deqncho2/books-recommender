Synopsis: In the quaint village of Hampshire, a young boy named Johnny befriends a dragon who is anything but fearsome.

However, when the villagers discover the dragon's existence, they demand that he be slain. Now, Johnny must find a way to convince the villagers that the dragon is not a threat, but a gentle creature with a love for peace and literature.
